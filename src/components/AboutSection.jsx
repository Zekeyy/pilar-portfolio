            Hi, I'm Ezekiel B. Pilar! I'm an Information Technology Fresh Graduate with a passion for web development and photography. I love the process of building websitesâ€”from writing clean, functional code to designing user-friendly interfaces. Seeing an idea come to life on the screen is something that excites me.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Aside from coding, I have a creative side that comes out through photography. Capturing moments, playing with lighting, and telling stories through images is something I truly enjoy. Whether it's behind a camera or in front of a screen, I love creating and bringing ideas to life.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            I'm always eager to learn, improve my skills, and explore new opportunities in both web development and photography.
